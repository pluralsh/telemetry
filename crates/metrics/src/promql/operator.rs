//! The [`Operator`] trait that every node in the query plan implements,
//! plus the two pieces of plan-time metadata every operator carries:
//! [`StepGrid`] (the `(start, end, step)` timeline batches land on) and
//! [`OperatorSchema`] (series roster + step grid — everything a consumer
//! needs before the first batch arrives).
//!
//! The trait is pull-based: consumers call `next` and drive work forward one
//! batch at a time. Its `Poll<Option<Result<_>>>` shape mirrors
//! [`futures::Stream`] but the trait stays runtime-agnostic — no `async fn`,
//! no pinning requirement — so planners can compose heterogeneous operators
//! as `Box<dyn Operator>`.
//!
//! Operator invariants:
//! - [`Operator::schema`] is callable before any [`Operator::next`], so
//!   downstream operators can size buffers and precompute maps up front.
//! - [`Operator::next`] returning `Poll::Ready(None)` is terminal; callers
//!   must not poll again.
